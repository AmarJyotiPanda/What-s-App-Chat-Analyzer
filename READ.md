A streamlit app to analyze your whatsapp chats

What’s app Chat Analyzer is a data analysis-based engine where you can upload the WhatsApp chat in text format and generate a complete analysis report according to or group or an individual.
Over here we added few things in our chat analyzer like it can count total no of words, messages , media files ,emojis ,monthly timeline, daily timeline , most busy users and many more.

Some libraries which we used in our program are Pandas, matplotlib , Streamlit , Seaborn, Wordcloud and Urlextract etc.It can track our conversation and analysis how much time we are spending on what’s App.
At the end of this project, you can expect to have valuable insights and visualizations of your WhatsApp chat data, potentially revealing trends and patterns in your conversations.
